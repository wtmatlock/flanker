## What is Flanker?

Flanker is designed to allow you to easily extract flanking sequences of genes (e.g. AMR/virulence genes). These flanking sequences are exported as FASTA files to allow easy downstream processing to integrate into any pipeline you may wish to use. Aditionally flanker allows you to cluster these sequences using Mash.
